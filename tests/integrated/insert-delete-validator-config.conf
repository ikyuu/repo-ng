; The test rules below are for test suite TestBasicCommandInsertDelete.
; Signed interests and data packets are signed by default certificate.
; In these test rules, the type of checker is fixed signer and signer type is file.
; Your computer default Identity should be "ndn/test/repo".
; So user who wants to run this test could use security tool to dump the defualt
; certificate into a file named "insert-delete-test.cert".
; If you don't want to change your default Identity, you should both change this configure file and
; source code to your own identity.
